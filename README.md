# Zsoft challenge
Zsoft challenge is a challenge hosted at Kaggle proposed by Zsoft which is is an IT consulting firm working on an automatic hiring system named “Hiring Master”.


This challenge is a natural language processing (NLP) problem. Participants will be provided with text snippets extracted from ZSoft-provided resumes, along with the specific section they were extracted from (Education, Experience, or Skills).\
The challenge requires participants to build a model that can accurately identify the section of the resume from which the text was extracted. The objective of this challenge is to develop a solution that can efficiently and accurately process resumes, allowing HR teams to streamline their recruitment process.


I created an NLP model using Transformers and BERT to solve the challenge, and after working on it for two days, I was able to achieve an accuracy of 82% (ps: due to a deadline, I had to stop the model in the third epoch). As a result, I ended up in fourth place.
