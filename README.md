# Zsoft challenge
Zsoft challenge is a challenge hosted at Kaggle proposed by Zsoft which is is an IT consulting firm working on an automatic hiring system named “Hiring Master”.\
This challenge is a natural language processing (NLP) problem. Participants will be provided with text snippets extracted from ZSoft-provided resumes, along with the specific section they were extracted from (Education, Experience, or Skills).\
The challenge requires participants to build a model that can accurately identify the section of the resume from which the text was extracted. The objective of this challenge is to develop a solution that can efficiently and accurately process resumes, allowing HR teams to streamline their recruitment process.\
In my participating in this challenge I create an NLP model using Transformers and bert model after a 2 days work I achieve an accuracy of 82%
